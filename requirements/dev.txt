# This file pulls in everything a developer needs that's not already in
# vendor or vendor-local.

# Things that can't be put into vendor or vendor-local because they build
# platform-specific libraries:
-r compiled.txt

# Things that aren't in vendor or vendor-local because they're only needed to
# run tests, not for production:
factory-boy==2.3.0
flake8==2.1.0
mock==0.8.0

# Just for building documentation
Sphinx==1.1.3
